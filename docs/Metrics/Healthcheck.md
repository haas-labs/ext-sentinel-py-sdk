# Health check

A web service should answer a health check request with a simple response indicating its 
current operational status. The purpose of a health check is to provide a quick and easy way 
to determine if the service is functioning properly. Here are some common practices for how 
a web service should respond to a health check:

## HTTP Status Codes

Use HTTP status codes to indicate the status of the service. Common status codes include:

- 200 OK: Indicates that the service is healthy and operational.
- 503 Service Unavailable: Indicates that the service is temporarily unavailable or experiencing 
    issues.

## Plain Text or JSON Response

Return a simple plain text or JSON response with a clear indication of the service's health status. 
For example:

- Plain text: "Service is healthy" or "Service is down".
- JSON: {"status": "healthy"} or {"status": "unhealthy"}.
- Response Time: Optionally, the health check response could include information about response 
  time or other performance metrics. However, this is not strictly necessary for a basic health check.

## Consistent Endpoint

Use a consistent endpoint URL for health checks, such as /health or /status, to make it easy for monitoring 
tools to find and check the service's health.

## Minimal Dependencies

Ensure that the health check endpoint has minimal dependencies on other services or components to avoid 
false positives or negatives. The health check should primarily verify the availability and basic 
functionality of the service itself.

## Custom Checks

Depending on the complexity of the service, custom health checks can be implemented to verify specific 
components or dependencies (e.g., database connectivity, file system access, etc.).

## Authentication

Consider whether the health check endpoint should be protected by authentication. In many cases, it's 
left unprotected for ease of monitoring, but in secure environments, authentication may be necessary.

## Monitoring and Logging

Log health check requests and responses for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes. This helps in 
understanding the historical health of the service and diagnosing any issues that arise.

A web service should respond to a health check with a clear indication of its operational status. 
Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

## HTTP Status Code

- 200 OK: This is the ideal response for a healthy service. It indicates the service is up and running normally.
- Non-200 Status Code: Any other status code signifies an issue. Common examples include:
- 500 Internal Server Error: The service encountered an internal problem and can't function properly.
- 503 Service Unavailable: The service is temporarily unavailable due to maintenance or overload.

## Response Body (Optional)

While not always mandatory, including a response body can provide additional details about 
the service's health. This information can be in various formats like JSON or plain text, depending 
on the implementation. Here are some possible inclusions:

Simple message: "OK" or "Healthy" for a successful check.
Detailed status: Information on specific components or dependencies within the service (database connection, 
external API health).

## Liveness vs. Readiness Checks

Some services differentiate between liveness and readiness checks using separate endpoints:

- /health/live: Responds with a 200 OK if the service process is running, even if not fully functional.
- /health/ready: Indicates if the service is ready to handle incoming traffic (all dependencies healthy).

## Choosing the Right Response

The specific response format and details depend on the monitoring system and the desired level of information.
