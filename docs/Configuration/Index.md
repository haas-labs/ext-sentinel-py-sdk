# Configuration

## Profile

The profile contains sentry configuration: inputs/outputs/databases. Most commonly, a profile for single detector or monitor configuration, but not limited for single use only. It can contains several sentries as well. In case of several sentries in a profile, it would be called as Bundle. For more details about bundles, please check [the link](Configuration/Bundle.md). 

The difference between a profile and a bundle - just in a number of sentries. In a profile, one detector/monitor per configuration. In a bundle, 2 and more detectors/monitors

## Bundle
