# Contract Bytecode

## Structure

### Initialization Code

This is the beginning part of the bytecode that contains the constructor and initialization logic of your smart contract. It sets up initial values, initializes variables, and performs any other necessary setup tasks. This section is executed only once during contract deployment.

### Runtime Code

This part of the bytecode contains the main body of your smart contract, including all the functions and logic you've written. It defines how the contract behaves and what actions it can perform. This section is executed whenever someone interacts with the contract by calling its functions.

### Constructor Parameters

If your contract has constructor parameters, they will be encoded within the initialization code. These parameters define the initial state of the contract and are passed during deployment.

### Jump Destinations

Ethereum bytecode uses relative jumps for control flow, which means instead of specifying absolute addresses, it uses relative offsets to jump to different parts of the code. These jump destinations are encoded within the bytecode.

### Metadata

Optional metadata can be included in the bytecode, typically used for debugging purposes or to provide additional information about the contract. This metadata is often generated by development tools and is not required for the contract to function.

### Other Metadata

Sometimes, additional metadata such as Swarm or IPFS hash may be included, especially if you're using tools like Truffle or Remix for contract development. This metadata helps in verifying the contract's source code and other related information.
