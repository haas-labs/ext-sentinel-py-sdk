Sentinel Python SDK is designed for building custom on-chain and off-chain data processors and detectors

- Research and prototyping, developing production-ready detectors
- Inputs/outputs/databases

  - Kafka Data Feed for Production
  - Event generation
- Seamlessly integrates with [Extractor](https://extractor.live)

Detector Examples:

- Contract Attacks
- Liquidity Monitoring
- DEX Activity
- Large Funds transfers
- MEV Arbitrage
- Spam Detection
- Labels collection
- ...

Sentinel supports all blockchain networks supported by [Extractor](https://extractor.live) (e.g. Ethereum,Arbitrum,BSC,...). Check Extractor for getting a full list of supported networks.
